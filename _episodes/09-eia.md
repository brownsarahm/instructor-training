> ## Bringing your own Experiences to this
>
> The Carpentries acknowledges that some of our instructor trainees, not only
> our learners at technical workshops, will have personal, visceral, relationships

> this section may be very new.
>
> Recall that Instructor Training is both a workshop on evidence based teaching

## A Positive Environment for All

As we have seen, there are many teaching practices that can make your workshop more positive and welcoming.
However, everyone's experiences begin, end, and are influenced by the world beyond a workshop; workshops do not occur in a vacuum.
In this section we will discuss some of the systemic barriers that can result in members
of some groups being excluded even in an otherwise welcoming environment. The fact that some groups face barriers
that others do not means a one size fits all approach will not successfully create a positive learning environment for all.
We are going to build on what we have learned about learning so far to consider how to ensure that all learners
at our workshops are able to learn effectively and feel welcome in our community.  

Most importantly, we will discuss how The Carpentries supports you as an instructor in creating an inclusive environment.



### Definitions

This section addresses topics related to equity, inclusion, and accessibility. These terms are increasingly common
and may be familiar to you, but not everyone understands or interprets them in the same way. So, we will start
with a few working definitions, adapted from the [University of Pittsburgh DEI Glossary][glossary]:

**Equity:** The proportional distribution of desirable outcomes across groups. Sometimes confused with equality,
equity refers to outcomes while equality connotes equal treatment.

**Inclusion:**  Actively engaging traditionally excluded individuals and/or groups in processes, activities
and decisions in a way that shares power. Inclusion promotes broad engagement, shared participation,
and advances authentic sense of belonging through safe, positive, and nurturing environments.

**Accessibility:** Refers to the intentional design or redesign of technology, policies, products, and services (to name a few)
that increase one's ability to use, access, and obtain the respective item. Each person is afforded the opportunity to acquire
the same information, engage in the same interactions, and enjoy the same services in an equally effective and equally
integrated manner, with substantially equivalent ease of use.

### The Carpentries Core Values

In 2019, The Carpentries formed a task force that worked with our community to identify 9 [Core Values][core-values] --
things that we do, things that we are, and things that we champion. Many of these relate to equity, inclusion, and accessibility,
which is one reason these are important in a Carpentries workshop. Remember this training is about how to teach in the
Carpentries, so learning our community values is a core outcome.  

> ## Discuss The Carpentries Core Values
>
1. Read through the Core Values on this page: <https://carpentries.org/values/>
2. Choose one core value that resonates with you.
3. Describe one action you might make in a workshop to actively pursue the core value you chose.
4. Identify the connection(s) between the core value you chose and equity, inclusion and/or accessibility.

> This exercise should take about 5 minutes.

## A mental model for instructors

EIA are important to upholding the carpentries core values and they are important
for learning.


As Instructors, many aspects of our classroom environment are within our control or influence.
However, the world is a complicated place, and there will always be extraneous factors that
contribute to demotivation and add to cognitive load. These vary from person to person, but
members of certain groups often carry a heavier load due to systemic forces that disproportionately
impact them. One way to think about this is the effects of systemic oppressions take up some of
the available "bandwidth" for learning.  Many studies, summarized well in
[Bandwidth Recovery][bandwidthbook] have
examined the impact of individual teaching practices on inclusion and consistently find that
all groups benefit from the practice, and the most marginalized learners benefit the most.
Eff
Fortunately, many of these practices are the same evidence-based teaching practices that we
have already seen.
Inclusive teaching practices help learners manage their cognitive load and recover
bandwidth that otherwise might have been lost.
One such practice is values-affirmation. Earlier, we used a community-centered variation
of this practice to help set up for this discussion.


The other thing that we can control is our own awareness of the challenges these forces
present to teaching and learning. As with other demotivation pitfalls, we can also
think carefully about the language that we use and how we interact with our learners to
avoid reinforcing systemic bias and adding to our learners extraneous cognitive load
(the distraction part).


Barriers to accessibility encountered in a workshop can exclude a learner entirely.
Even if a learner is not excluded, these barriers are demotivating and therefore interfere with learning.
What barriers might be present in your workshop, and what can you do to remove them?





### From Accommodation to Universal Design
Accommodation means changing things to serve an individual with a demonstrated need.
However, **accommodation puts the onus on the individual with the need** to
disclose their disability and ask for accommodations. Reluctance to
do so is understandable: requests for accommodation are often met with negative
emotions such as uncertainty, confusion, annoyance or anger by those receiving the requests.  

By contrast, "universal design" means creating something to be maximally usable by all people
without additional changes.
A good example of universal design is curb cuts
and sidewalk ramps. While they were originally created to make it easier for
wheelchair users to move around, they proved to be equally helpful to people with strollers and grocery carts.

### Universal Design in Learning (UDL)

In the 1990s, the Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST) brought Universal Design
into Education with the [Universal Design in Learning (UDL) Framework][CAST].
UDL places responsibility for accessibility on the course designer rather than on the learner.
It states that the most inclusive approach to education is to design instruction with diverse learners in mind from the beginning.

UDL is not about finding the one, best way to teach everyone.
The key to UDL is creating redundancies such that learners have multiple options in how they:
1. receive
2. engage, and
3. share information.  

> ## Activity: Applying Universal Design in Your Teaching
>
> Consider some of the teaching tools and strategies we have discussed so far in this workshop, or others you have observed in your experience.
> How do these meet UDL goals of providing multiple options for learners?
>
> Consider multiple ways for learners to:
> - receive information
> - engage with you, the material, and other learners
> - share what they have learned
>
> This exercise should take about 10 minutes.

> Looking at people who work with disability and accessibility, it's

>
> *   *It is ok not to do everything at once.*
>     We do not ask learners in our workshops to adopt all our best practices or tools in one go,
>     but instead to add things gradually at a rate they can manage.
>     Similarly, try to build in accessibility habits when preparing for workshops
>     through reflective practice, adding something new each time.
> *   *Do the easy things first.*
>     There are plenty of ways to make workshops more accessible
>     that are both quick to accomplish and minimal in demands on attention:
>     font choices, text size, using captions online,
>     checking in advance that your room is accessible via an elevator or ramp, etc.

Wherever possible, when considering whether or how to change your approach to universal design,
make an effort to *involve people with disabilities in decision-making*.
Carpentries communications channels can be a good place to ask for advice more broadly.



### Stereotypes

We all use stereotypes, because they serve a cognitive purpose.
[One study][34gig] suggests we encounter more than 34 gigabytes of information every day.
That is more information than we could ever process, so our brains use shortcuts.
 Stereotypes are one of those shortcuts. As with other models,
they are all wrong... but some are dangerous.

### What are stereotypes?

Stereotypes are an established feature of human social cognition, in which a set of characteristics
is associated with members of a group. Stereotypes:
- may be explicit (conscious and deliberate) or implicit (unconscious and automatic)
- guide what we notice about people
- guide how we interpret people's behaviors
- can facilitate quick judgements in appropriate situations (e.g. stopping a child from driving a car)
- can lead to systematically negative attitudes and behaviors towards members of certain groups

Stereotypes are dangerous when they are explicit and especially hazardous when they are implicit. This
means that the people holding them may not be aware of them, even though their perceptions are guided by them.

**When Instructors have stereotypes about learners**, this may lead them to:
- call attention to differences unnecessarily
- give more or less attention to certain learners
- respond to questions differently for certain learners

**When learners experience stereotypes about themselves**, they may:
- develop a fixed mindset about aspects of their own capability
- experience increased cognitive load when reminded about a stereotype, interfering with the learning process. This is known as *stereotype threat*.

### What can we do about our own stereotypes?
- Get to know people from many different groups!
- Observe your own behavior, and build awareness of situations in which your perceptions and behaviors are influenced by stereotypes.
- Avoid calling attention to common stereotypes, even in a way that seems positive.

> ## Better Together

> One way to support at-risk learners of all kinds is to ask people to sign up for workshops in small teams
> rather than as individuals when possible.
> If an entire lab group comes,
> or if attendees are drawn from the same (or closely-related) disciplines,
> everyone in the room will know in advance
> that they will be with at least a few people they trust,
> which increases the chances of them actually coming.
> Furthermore,
> if people attend a workshop with their labmates, it's more likely they will
> work together to implement what they've learned after the workshop has ended.

### Examining your Actions

When you pay close attention to your own actions, this can help you to do more than (painfully) identify how often you
use the word "just"! Monitoring your actions can also provide you with useful information about the ways in which you behave
differently with different people. This is normal! It is also an excellent way to identify patterns that may interfere with your
intent to create an inclusive environment for all. Did you answer the same question in different ways at different points? If so, why?
Who did you feel comfortable chatting with at break time, and who seemed harder to connect with? Did you offer help to anyone who
did not ask for it? Who were you most eager to impress?

Asking yourself questions like these is hard! Answering them is harder.
When you notice things that trouble you, keep a positive and simple goal in mind: to learn and to improve.




## Institutional Support for Systemic Issues

In the Carpentries, we recognize that individuals play a role in reversing the
effects of systemic exclusion, but individual instructors cannot do it alone.
The Carpentries supports you in creating an inclusive environment and addressing
systemic exclusion by providing you with a structure of the event, best practices
you are learning in this workshop and by providing institutional support.

> ## What have we seen so far?
>
> In a small group in a breakout room or as a whole group on the etherpad,
> brainstorm different aspects of the Carpentries that support building an
> inclusive, equitable, and accessible learning environment.
>
> If you have questions about other resources or suggested resources, list those
> too.
>
> This exercise should take about 5 minutes
{: .challenge }


### Setting Expectations with the Code of Conduct

One central way that The Carpentries fosters an inclusive, respectful
learning environment is our [Code of Conduct][coc].

All participants in our workshops and communities are required to abide by the
[Code of Conduct][coc].
This code helps to ensure that our community does not tolerate the persistence of behaviors
that harm or exclude others. While such a code cannot prevent all incidents, reminding
participants of the Code of Conduct supports them in
being mindful of the impact of their words and actions. It also offers reassurance
to all that the instructional team cares about their experience, creating
an environment that is explicitly inclusive and supports safe focus
on learning.

We will discuss the Code of Conduct in greater detail in Part 4 of this training during
our discussion of Working with your team.

### Listening with Assessment and Feedback

Motivating practices like those discussed in the previous episode to invite participation and encourage a growth mindset can also
contribute to making a classroom more inclusive for a diverse set of learners.
However, we still need listen to our audience and not assume that any instructional approach has succeeded at fostering inclusion.
Explicitly seeking to learn from and attend to the concerns of your learners is key. If you find yourself feeling
uncertain about whether you are successfully including all learners, that is a good time to pause and create an opportunity
to listen.

When you are actively providing avenues for feedback, there are two signs of trouble to watch out for: negative feedback, and a **lack of feedback**.
Many learners will not feel comfortable reporting that the environment does not feel inclusive; indeed, they may not recognize it
themselves. It can be difficult to notice the people you are *not* hearing from in a room! When in doubt, communicate with your team and
work together to identify and (gently) check in with anyone you have not heard from. In addition, examine your feedback processes to be sure you are
including opportunities for **anonymous feedback**.



### Accessibility Support

If you are playing the host role (or part of it), note that our [host template][handbook-host-template]
includes an invitation to share accessibility needs. However, be aware that **many
people will not feel comfortable requesting accommodations in advance**, or at all if it can be avoided.
For example, a participant who is hard of hearing may simply hope that
instructors will speak loudly enough for them to hear. Taking steps to make
your workshop maximally accessible can relieve your participants of the need to disclose personal information.


For a short checklist of things to keep in mind for in-person workshop locations, see [the accessibility checklist][handbook-accessibility-checklist]
in The Carpentries Handbook. In particular, take note that the most frequent accessibility challenge noted in [Carpentries post-assessment
surveys][post-surveys] is difficulty hearing an Instructor from the back of the room.


There is an accessibility coordinator on the core team <info> .


### Lesson Materials

Our lesson template provides <fill in >

Our materials use inclusive language and have been reviewed by people from all
over the globe.  We regularly rephrase things to remove regionally specific
idioms and culturally specific analogies. This is another reason to trust our
materials when you are teaching.

### Extending Specific Invitations

We aim to make Carpentries programs *equitable* because our learners experiences
beyond our workshops are unequal, including
historical and present-day differences in
access to resources, mentorship, and other avenues towards career success.
This means that we aim to use our programs to *actively* counter-balance unequal opportunities that have led to
disproportionate representation of certain groups in data-centric careers,
rather than offering the same access and experience to all.
The Carpentries takes the lead on this by < sloan grant, etc>.

If you host a workshop, we encourage you to consider means of reaching out to historically under-represented
groups in your community who may be interested in attending and extending an explicit invitation.

While it may not be possible to anticipate all needs,
it *is* possible to get a good working structure in place
without any knowledge of what specific disabilities people might have.
Having some accommodations prepared also demonstrates care, helping
learners to trust that additional requests are likely to be well received.
This in turn increases the likelihood that learners will request what they need.
